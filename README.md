# Sprint 5: Markov Chain Models

## Overview


## Topics

1. Markov chains as state transition models
2. The Markov property
3. Discrete-time Markov chains
4. Global balance and the steady-state probabilities
5. Continuous-time Markov chains
6. Using Markov chains to derive queueing equations

## Deliverables


## Resources

[This post from Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-markov-chains-50da3645a50d) gives another accessible overview to Markov chains.

[This book chapter](https://bookdown.org/probability/beta/markov-chains.html) (up to the section on hidden Markov models, which are interesting, but not something we're going to cover in this class)

## Timeline

We'll do more direct instruction in class for this sprint. Here's an approximate schedule:

- Monday (11/4): Overview of Markov chains, discrete chain example, solving the global balance equations

- Wednesday (11/6): Continuous-time chains, using a chain to model the M/M/1 queue, deriving queueing equations

- Monday (11/11):
