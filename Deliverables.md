## Make Randomized Text Great Again

Creating randomized text generators is a fun application of Markov chains.

The model starts by picking a random starting word, then randomly choosing the next word, in such a way that words pairs occurring more
frequently in the source text are more likely to be chosen by the generator. This process then repeats, randomly choosing the next word
based on the current word.

Clone this public repo:

```
git clone cms380-f18-lab-2
```

It tells you how to use a tool named `markovify` to generate random sentences. Work through the examples it contains and record your
five best random tweets.
